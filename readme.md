# Mars Rovers


A test first, functional(ish) approach to solve the Mars Rovers problem. https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/

It doesn't have much of bad case handling as it is not specified in the description of the problem how to handle. 

I tried to adhere to some functional programming principles:
- objects are immutable
- no state is kept in instances
